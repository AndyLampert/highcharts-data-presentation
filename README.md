Library Demo

Objective
Learn a new 3rd-party library and develop a demo within your peer group to teach the rest of the class.

Skills
Reading documentation.
Understanding conventions within the Javascript community.
Resolving ambiguities.
Knowing how libraries fit together into a larger system.

Resources

1) http://microjs.com/#
2) https://nodejsmodules.org/
3) https://www.npmjs.org/
4) http://bower.io/search/
5) https://github.com/trending?l=javascript&since=monthly

Requirements

1) Use the resources above to find a Javascript library that you want to learn and incorporate into a small project. Each person in your peer group can search on their own, or you can search together. Pick one library to focus on. Even if you incorporate other libraries, this is the library you will be demonstrating to the rest of the class.

2) Create a project in collaboration that demonstrates the chosen library. You have a short time to put something together (just a couple days) so keep it very simple. However, you have multiple people you can delegate work to. If each person has one feature to create, you can create something interesting.

3) Each teammate must develop their changes in a separate branch, which gets merged into master. The Introduction Sequence on the Learn Git Branching tutorial will show you everything you need to do this.

4) At the end of the week your peer group will present your demonstration to the class and briefly show what the library does and how to use it. It shouldn't be a walkthrough demo, but you should show code and explain what steps are needed to use it.
